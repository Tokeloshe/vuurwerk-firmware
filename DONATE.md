# Buy Me a Coffee

If VUURWERK has improved your radio experience, consider sending a small donation. Every contribution helps fund continued development of open-source RF firmware for the Quansheng UV-K5.

## Donate via XRP (Ripple)

**Payment Address:**
```
rf82s1CDagppvM6ATqc1nSrL6GackzHJrm
```

**Memo (REQUIRED):**
```
2621443948
```

> **IMPORTANT:** You MUST include the memo with your payment. Without it, the transaction cannot be credited to VUURWERK development. Most XRP wallets have a "Destination Tag" or "Memo" field. Enter `2621443948` there.

## How to Send XRP

1. Open your XRP wallet (Xumm, Trust Wallet, Ledger, Exodus, Uphold, etc.)
2. Select **Send** or **Transfer**
3. Enter the address: `rf82s1CDagppvM6ATqc1nSrL6GackzHJrm`
4. Enter the memo/destination tag: `2621443948`
5. Enter any amount you'd like to contribute
6. Confirm and send

If your wallet asks for a "Destination Tag" instead of "Memo", enter the same number: `2621443948`. They are the same thing.

## Thank You

VUURWERK is built by one developer, James Honiball (KC3TFZ), with a love of radio inherited from his grandfather George Thomas Honiball (ZS6NE, Silent Key). Every line of code in this firmware was written to make the UV-K5 a better radio for serious operators.

Your support means this work can continue. Whether it's a few XRP or just a kind word on the forums, it all matters.
