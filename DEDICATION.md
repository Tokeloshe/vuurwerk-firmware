# Dedication

**VUURWERK** is dedicated to the memory of

## George Thomas Honiball -- ZS6NE

### Silent Key

Electro-Mechanical Engineer. Radio amateur. Member of the South African Radio League and the Magalies Amateur Radio Club. Grandfather.

George spent his life building things that worked -- circuits, machines, and a standard of excellence he refused to compromise on. He was a man who commanded respect not by asking for it, but by knowing exactly what he was doing and doing it right. He understood that a radio is more than components and frequencies. It is a connection across distance, across time, and between generations.

He is a silent key now, but not in and through me.

VUURWERK is built by **James Edward Honiball -- KC3TFZ**, grandson of ZS6NE, carrying forward the work that began at a workbench in South Africa and continues in every transmission from this firmware.

This project is dedicated to anyone who refuses to quit, who sees hope in humanity and who have overcome so much and even when knocked down still prove their worth. Nothing can get us down.

*"Vuurwerk"* -- Afrikaans for *fireworks*. Light in the dark. Signal through the noise.

### Preservation Notice

If you fork, modify, or redistribute this software, you are kindly asked to preserve this dedication in its entirety. George Thomas Honiball ZS6NE gave his grandson a love of radio and engineering that made this project possible. That lineage deserves to travel with the code.
